# TrackerOfProjects
Week #5 Mini Project to build a project tracker.

## The Vision:
My vision for the project tracker was to make it look like it came out of an elementary school, using primary colours, rounded edges, some scribbley handwriting, basic primary colours only (RGB).

## Languages & Frameworks Used:
For this project I used HTML, custom CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript

## Pictures:
