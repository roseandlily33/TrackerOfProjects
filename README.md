# TrackerOfProjects
Week #5 Mini Project to build a project tracker.

## The Vision:
My vision for the project tracker was to make it look like it came out of an elementary school, using primary colours, rounded edges, some scribbley handwriting, basic primary colours only (RGB).

## Languages & Frameworks Used:
I was able to do quite a bit of the project on my own and knew the direction that it should go but, I relied quite a bit on the JavaScript that was given to us as an example to complete the project, but I must say it really helped me learn more that I can see it all come together, and how the things work, what do do in this kind of thing with event delegation which is hard to wrap your head around at first, I also had gaps that I wasn't sure how to do. But I still wanted to put it up because I think that my idea behind it is really cute and I'm happy with how it turned out.
For this project I used HTML, custom CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript

## Difficulties
First time using bootstrap, so that was a learning curve but it's actually quite simple and it makes doing the responsive designs a lot easier. Using event delegation was difficult, but I am starting to understand that more and more as I do it.

## How to use:
Select the Add new project button on the top right in red, put in your prokect name, the languages that are associated with the project and it's due date, press save changes in green, and your project should appear on the screen. To delete a project press the X on the right hand side.
